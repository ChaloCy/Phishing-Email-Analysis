## Case Background  
I was tasked to investigate a phishing email reported by a finance employee in a corporate environment. The email appeared to come from the CEO, urgently requesting the review of a financial document.
The email contained a suspicious link:  

<img width="561" height="205" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64895b3d-1e0b-4f5e-ab1f-0048583fa0a4" />

Given the sensitive nature of the request, it immediately raised suspicion. 

## Email Analysis

Upon reviewing the email, I discovered several indicators of a phishing attempt:

1. **Urgency Cues:**  
   The email’s urgent tone pressured John to act quickly. This sense of urgency is a common tactic in phishing emails to prompt quick, unthinking actions.

2. **Suspicious URL:**  
   The link in the email used `hxxp` instead of `http`. Malicious emails often include such slightly altered links to evade detection while appearing legitimate at first glance.

3. **Impersonation:**  
   The email claimed to be from the CEO but lacked a proper signature, indicating potential impersonation.
   
These factors confirmed that the email was a targeted phishing attempt aimed at John, likely due to his access to sensitive financial data.

## Metadata and IP Analysis

To gather threat intelligence and understand the origin of the suspicious IP address, I performed a **WHOIS lookup** for the IP address `23.94.182.50`. This process allowed me to obtain detailed information about the IP address, including its **location** and the **organization** to which it is registered.

- **WHOIS Findings:**  
  - The IP address `23.94.182.50` is part of a range allocated to **HostPapa**, a hosting provider based in Buffalo, New York.  
  - Specifically, the subnet `23.94.182.0/26` is reassigned to **ColoCrossing**, another organization operating from the same address.  
  - Both HostPapa and ColoCrossing are located at **325 Delaware Avenue, Suite 300, Buffalo, NY, USA**.

Using this information, I cross-referenced the IP address details with the known location of our CEO. This comparison confirmed that the email was not sent from the CEO, thereby reinforcing its **suspicious nature**.

- **VirusTotal Findings:**  
  Further investigation using **VirusTotal** revealed that the IP address `23.94.182.50` had been flagged multiple times as **malicious or suspicious**.  
  - **11 out of 92** security vendors identified this IP as problematic.  
  - The IP address has a history of being associated with malicious activity and potential malware.

## Link Analysis

This raised immediate red flags due to its unusual format. The use of **`hxxp` instead of `http`** is a common tactic employed by attackers to:  
- Evade automated detection systems.  
- Bypass URL filters.  
- Make the link appear less threatening at a quick glance.  

Such links typically redirect victims to malicious websites or attempt to download malware onto the recipient's device.

### VirusTotal Findings
To further investigate the URL, I used **VirusTotal**, a comprehensive online tool for scanning URLs against multiple security vendors. 

Key observations:  
- The domain has a **long history of malicious activity**.  
- **First flagged**: February 3, 2016.  
- **Most recent detection**: July 25, 2024.  
- Multiple security vendors consistently detected it as **malicious**.  

This persistent detection across years highlights that the URL is part of a **phishing scheme designed to deceive and harm recipients**.

<img width="808" height="368" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5469ba59-9cff-4968-b63d-4fad6da0b1ad" />

**Conclusion:**  
The URL is confirmed to be **dangerous and malicious**, further validating that the email was a **phishing attempt** aimed at:  
- Compromising sensitive information.  
- Distributing malware to corporate systems.

## Incident Response
Upon discovering the phishing attempt, immediate actions were taken to **secure and preserve potential evidence**. The first step was to **isolate the affected devices**, preventing further interaction between the perpetrator and the targeted employee (*John*).  

Isolating devices is critical in incident response because it ensures that:  
- Potential evidence is preserved.  
- Malicious activity cannot continue.  
- The scope of compromise is contained.  

### Employee Interview
To further analyze the incident, I questioned John regarding his actions after receiving the email:  
- Did he respond to the email?  
- Did he click on the suspicious link?  

Understanding John’s behavior is essential to determine:  
- The extent of the potential compromise.  
- Whether sensitive data may have been exposed.  
- What evidence must be preserved.  

### Communication & Coordination
Next, it was essential to **notify the IT/Cybersecurity team and management** about the phishing attempt.  

I proposed a meeting with key stakeholders:  
- **IT Department**  
- **Cybersecurity Team**  
- **Management**  

During this meeting, I presented findings from the **initial analysis (Phase 1, 2, and 3)**, explaining why this was confirmed as a phishing attempt.  

Additionally, it was important to:  
- Inform John and other employees about the phishing attempt.  
- Remind them of **best practices** through internal communication or refresher training.  
- Reinforce awareness and vigilance across the organization.  

### Containment & Remediation Steps
The following actions were implemented to contain and mitigate the incident:  

**a. Isolation** – Identified compromised or potentially compromised devices were isolated from the network to prevent lateral spread.  

**b. Preservation** – All digital evidence (logs, configs, email headers, timestamps, etc.) was secured and preserved to reconstruct a timeline of events.  

**c. Network Monitoring** – Tools such as *Wireshark* were used to monitor for anomalies (e.g., unusual traffic spikes), which could indicate ongoing malicious activity.  

**d. System Disconnection** – Any systems suspected of compromise were fully disconnected from the network to block attacker communication.  

### Compliance Implications
All actions taken were **documented in a chain of custody** to ensure evidence integrity. This documentation is critical for:  
- Future investigations or audits.  
- Regulatory compliance.  
- Maintaining organizational transparency.  

Depending on the severity of the incident and the type of data potentially compromised, **regulatory bodies may need to be notified**. Ensuring compliance with relevant laws and industry standards is vital to:  
- Protect organizational integrity.  
- Avoid legal or financial repercussions.

## Forensic Investigation

If the employee had clicked the malicious link, the forensic investigation would involve several critical steps to identify and analyze potential compromises on their machine.  

The **primary goals** of this investigation are to:  
- Gain a comprehensive understanding of the incident.  
- Identify and preserve evidence.  
- Take effective remediation actions.  

### Initial Findings
- During the **incident response phase**, evidence preservation revealed that the attacker sent a phishing email to *John* containing a malicious link.  
- Once clicked, the link installed a **backdoor** on his system.  
- This backdoor granted the attacker **unauthorized access** to the organization’s private network.  

### Log Analysis
The next step would be a **detailed log analysis**:  
- **System logs** – Checked for unusual login attempts or privilege escalations.  
- **Network logs** – Reviewed for suspicious traffic, unauthorized access attempts, or data exfiltration.  
- **Indicators of compromise (IOCs)** – Extracted attacker IPs, timestamps, and malware activity.  

Log analysis helps **reconstruct the attack timeline** and determine the **scope of compromise**.  

### Vulnerability Assessment
To identify system weaknesses, I would run targeted scans:  

- **Nmap** – To scan for **open ports** that attackers could exploit.  
- **Nikto** – To scan web servers for vulnerabilities, such as:  
  - Outdated software.  
  - Misconfigurations.  
  - Known security holes.  

These findings are critical for:  
- Implementing stricter access controls.  
- Closing non-essential ports.  
- Hardening servers against future attacks.  

### Remediation Actions
After identifying breaches and vulnerabilities:  
1. **Patching** – Apply updates to close security gaps.  
2. **Threat Removal** – Eliminate malware, backdoors, and other artifacts from compromised systems.  
3. **Network-wide Scans** – Inspect all connected devices to ensure no lingering threats remain.  
4. **Configuration Hardening** – Secure servers, restrict access, and enforce stronger policies.  

### Outcome
A comprehensive forensic process ensures that:  
- The attacker’s access is removed.  
- The organization’s IT infrastructure regains integrity.  
- Future incidents of similar nature are prevented.
